# Ring-Modulator-for-DSB-SC-Generation
The objective of this activity is to describe the operation of a diode ring mixer, to identify some of its applications, and to learn the basics of the produces double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSBSC) signals.


Description:
In this simulation:
L1 = 1 mH
L6 = 1 mH
L2, L3, L4, L5 = 10 mH
The larger inductors (L2–L5) represent the secondary windings.
The smaller inductors (L1 and L6) represent the primary windings.
This produces a step-up transformer, increasing signal amplitude.
The higher secondary voltage ensures:
Proper switching of the 1N914 diodes
Better carrier suppression
Clear modulation envelope
If all inductors were equal, the voltage might not be high enough to fully switch the diodes, resulting in weaker modulation.
